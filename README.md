# DupDetect:- 
The Data Duplication Alert System (DDAS) is a full-stack project built to proactively detect and prevent duplicate data downloads in systems where data consistency, uniqueness, and efficiency are critical.

Whether it's user-generated content, file downloads, or transactional records â€” DDAS ensures one-click = one copy.
